# test-file-inventory
A collection of files used for testing file uploaders


# Contributing

This collection should contain only sensible images that you feel others would be happy to upload to their sites for testing purposes and potentially leave there.

'Malicilious' files must not do anything that is actually malicious, but show examples how how they could be. For example an image file which has an embedded javascript alert saying 'hello' is what we are going for here.

When it comes to mimetypes, file sizes, dimentions, aspect ratios, encoding etc - the wierder and wonderuflly the better.

Please name your files as descriptively as possible to make it easy to indentify what they are from a file selection window.
